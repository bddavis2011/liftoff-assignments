# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Keyboard Cats is a useful app dedicated to helping people find all their local cat needs.  Our app will not only help answer basic new cat owner questions, (Is that hacking sound normal? Do they always zoom around meowing at 3am?)  but we can point you in the direction of your local non-kill shelters, provide local vet info, and even help you find that adorable cat cafe your best friend was talking about just last week!  
Keyboard Cats will be able to allow users to add their cats to their profile to help track things like vet needs, vaccination reminders and can even push those notifications to your phone or email.  But if you don’t have any cats or don’t want to register, you can still use most of the features of the app. There is also a wonderful feature, a symptom checker, to help cat owners decide if their cat’s symptoms are cause for concern or perfectly normal.
